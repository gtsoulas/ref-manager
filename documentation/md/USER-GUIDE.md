## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What's the difference between Internal Panel and Critical Friends?**
A: Internal Panel are university staff reviewing internally. Critical Friends are external reviewers from other institutions. Use Internal Panel for first review and quality assurance, Critical Friends for external validation.

**Q: Should I delete former staff?**
A: NO! Mark them as "Former" instead. This preserves their outputs and contribution history while removing them from active dropdowns.

**Q: What's the difference between colleague categories?**
A: Categories identify research roles: Independent researchers can submit independently, Non-independent (like post-docs) may have different rules, External co-authors are from other institutions. Choose the category that best describes their status for REF purposes.

**Q: How often should I back up?**
A: Daily for production systems. Weekly minimum for development. Use automated backup scripts.

### Output Management

**Q: What if an output has multiple authors from our department?**
A: Select the lead author in the "Author" field. All authors are listed in "All Authors" field. The lead author gets credit for required output calculation.

**Q: Can I change quality ratings later?**
A: Yes! Ratings can be updated as you get more reviews and information. Track the reasons for changes.

**Q: What if I don't know the quality rating yet?**
A: Use "Unclassified" initially. Update after internal and external reviews.

**Q: How do I handle a book with multiple chapters?**
A: Each chapter can be a separate output if eligible. Or treat the whole book as one output. Follow REF guidelines for your discipline.

### Import/Export ⭐ NEW

**Q: Why did my CSV import fail?**
A: Common issues:
- File not UTF-8 encoded
- Missing required columns
- Invalid dates (use YYYY-MM-DD)
- Email doesn't match colleague in system
- Special characters in data

**Q: Can I update existing outputs via CSV?**
A: Yes! If title or DOI matches, you can choose to update existing outputs. Be careful not to overwrite good data.

**Q: Why can't I click the links in my exported Excel?**
A: Links work when PDFs are uploaded and accessible. Check:
- PDF was uploaded for that output
- You have network access to server
- File path is correct

**Q: Can I email the Excel export directly to reviewers?**
A: Yes! That's exactly what it's designed for. Reviewers can click links to access papers directly.

### Tasks ⭐ NEW

**Q: Should I create a task for every output?**
A: No. Tasks are for administrative activities, deadlines, meetings, and coordination. Use assignments for output reviews.

**Q: Can I assign one task to multiple people?**
A: Not directly. Create separate tasks or use the description to mention multiple people involved.

**Q: What happens to completed tasks?**
A: They remain in the system for audit trail. Filter by status to hide completed tasks from daily view.

**Q: When should I use "Urgent" priority?**
A: For critical items due today or tomorrow, or things blocking other work. Don't overuse - saves meaning for true urgencies.

### Reviews

**Q: How many reviews should each output get?**
A: Recommended: 1-2 internal panel reviews plus 1 external critical friend review. More for borderline cases.

**Q: What if internal and external reviews disagree?**
A: Common! This is why you need both. Panel should discuss, consider evidence, and make final decision. Document reasoning.

**Q: How long should reviews take?**
A: Internal: 1-2 weeks. External: 2-4 weeks. Build in buffer time for delays.

**Q: Can Critical Friends see internal reviews?**
A: No, they're separate systems. Internal reviews inform your decisions, external reviews provide validation. Don't share internal reviews unless you want to.

### Technical

**Q: What if the server stops?**
A: If using systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ref-manager
sudo systemctl restart ref-manager
```
Check logs for errors:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u ref-manager -n 100
```

**Q: How do I add another user?**
A: Via Django admin:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Or through admin panel (http://localhost:8000/admin/).

**Q: Can I access from multiple computers?**
A: Yes! If running on a server:
1. Set ALLOWED_HOSTS in .env
2. Run server on 0.0.0.0:8000
3. Access via http://server-ip:8000
For production, use Nginx/Gunicorn setup.

**Q: How do I upgrade to a new version?**
A: 
1. Backup database
2. Pull/download new code
3. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run: python manage.py migrate
5. Run: python manage.py collectstatic
6. Restart server
